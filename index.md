김경희. 2022. 서울시민카드 사용자 유입과 이탈에 대한 시계열 이상치 탐지와 DTW 클러스터링. 통계연구, 22(0) : 63-76

The study analyzes the inflow and departure of Seoul citizens' card users by gender and age group. First, fit the ARMA model and get estimates to detect outliers in univariate time series. Secondly, Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) clustering subsequently enables identify bound clusters. This study aims to help develop the use of Seoul citizens' cards by enhancing the understanding of user behaviours.

## Towards a Rigorous Evaluation of Time-Series Anomaly Detection (Review)

[![Open Presentation](https://img.shields.io/badge/PDF-Open_Research_Poster-blue?logo=adobe-acrobat-reader&logoColor=white)](pdf/TAD.pdf)

Anomaly detection; AD
As Industry 4.0 accelerates system automation, consequences of system failures can have significant social impact(Lee 2008). To prevent this failure, the detection of anomalous is more important. However, the paper introduces pitfalls of TAD evaluation and suggests some other methods to evaluate TAD rigorously.

In bayesian framework, mostly local prior is used for model select. In this paper, nonlocal prior would be better to model select for some reasons.
1. model consistency
2. less RMSE

## Time Series representation for clustering using umbalanced Haar wavelet transformation (Review)

[![Open Presentation](https://img.shields.io/badge/PDF-Open_Research_Poster-blue?logo=adobe-acrobat-reader&logoColor=white)](pdf/haar.pdf)

Recent time series data tend to be very high-dimensional and high-frequency.  
Due to heavy computation, many studies have been conducted on the dimension reduction method to efficiently handle classification and clustering. (e.g. DFT, DWT, PAA)
In this paper, DUHT(Discrete Unbalanced Haar Wavelet Tramsformation, Fryzlewicz, 2007) is mainly used.
